### Sending a standard push
```
// The channel we want this notification to be pushed to (Android Only). This allows for grouping of notifications.
// The channel must have been initialized inside the expo app already.
$channel = "notifications";

// This contains data we need inside the app to move the user to a specific screen or handle some other things.
$data  = [
    "intent"=>'notification',
    'type'=>'chat',
    'message'=>'Hello'
];

$send = PushNotification::send(['ExponentPushToken[oj4iK4CRA7Ry8gDCrtawef]'], 'Test','Test body', $channel, $data);
